# Legal Eagles in the Cloud: Hacking the Court System (Legally) with Google


Ever since I binge-watched Matlock, I've always dreamed of being a great lawyer, deftly navigating the complexities of the courtroom and delivering dramatic closing arguments. While my legal career may have taken a different turn, I'm excited to say that with the help of AI, we might all be closer to that courtroom dream. 

Today, we're diving into how to use Google's powerful AI tools - like Vertex AI, Firestore and Cloud run- to process and understand legal data, perform lightning-fast searches, and maybe, just maybe, help your imaginary client (or yourself) out of a sticky situation. You might not be cross-examining a witness, but with our system you'll be able to sift through mountains of information, get clear summaries, and present the most relevant information in seconds. 

So, letâ€™s get started and see how far we can get using AI to explore the legal world, without the courtroom drama.

### Set up Firestore Database in Google Cloud
1. In the Navigation menu, scroll down to "Databases" and click on "Firestore".
2. Choose "Native mode". Important: Vector Search in Firestore is currently only supported in Native mode. Select "Native mode" and click "Select Native mode".
3. Select a location: Choose a region for your Firestore database. It's generally recommended to choose the same region as your Cloud Run service and GCS bucket for optimal performance and reduced latency.
Click "Create Database". Firestore will provision your database, which might take a few moments.




### Implement search with via command line,
